Å°0x01.) Preface

 I just visited the KENJI's Blog website and found that he says that "I'll 
write my English Blog, this year!!!123!!!2008!!". Wow. That is very cool. 
He is always cool. So I decided to write this article in English. 

 Don't worry. My English is almost perfect. If you can not understand my 
English, it's your fault. Not mine. he he he...


Å°0x02.) The problems of Bookmarklet

 If you understand JavaScript, you know Bookmarklet. I don't explain what 
Bookmarklet is here, because you have G00gle. 

 Though Bookmarklets are powerful and convenient, there are two big problems. 
First, there is a size limitation. Second, We have to write the JavaScript 
code in one line. Those problems are really painful. We need cure.


Å°0x03.) Using DOM

 #Of course DOM is the Document Object Model, not the Download Only Member, 
he he he...

 We can solve these problems of Bookmarklets using the code like below.

-----
javascript:var a=document.createElement( 'script' );a.setAttribute('src','http://www.jumperz.net/exploits/wb38.js?'+(new Date-0));document.childNodes[0].appendChild(a);void(0);
-----

 You can register a new bookmarklet with this value as URL. If you execute 
the bookmarklet, the code will run on your web browser. The code itself is 
located on the server ( http://www.jumperz.net/exploits/wb38.js ). We can 
use multiple lines in the remote JavaScript file and there is no size 
limitation. Enjoy!!!


Å°0x04.) 3 Years Later...

 I just found another person have found the same technique.
